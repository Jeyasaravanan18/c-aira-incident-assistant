INCIDENT REPORT #2024-003
Date: 2024-01-20
Severity: Medium
Status: Resolved

SUMMARY:
Disk space exhaustion on application servers causing service degradation and failed deployments.

SYMPTOMS:
- Application logs not being written
- Deployment pipeline failing with "No space left on device"
- Server health checks intermittently failing
- Slow application response times
- Disk usage at 100% on /var partition

ROOT CAUSE:
Log rotation was not configured properly for the application logs. Debug-level logging was enabled in production, generating excessive log volume (50GB+ per day). Old logs were not being cleaned up automatically.

RESOLUTION STEPS:
1. Identified /var/log/application/ consuming 95% of disk space
2. Compressed and archived logs older than 7 days
3. Deleted archived logs older than 30 days
4. Changed log level from DEBUG to INFO in production
5. Configured logrotate to rotate daily and keep only 14 days
6. Set up disk space monitoring alerts at 80% threshold
7. Verified log rotation working correctly

PREVENTION:
- Implemented automated log cleanup scripts
- Added disk space monitoring to all servers
- Created alerts for disk usage > 80%
- Updated deployment checklist to verify log rotation config
- Documented log management best practices

TIME TO RESOLUTION: 1 hour 30 minutes
